### Overview

__pvper__ is a C++ bare metal programming environment for the Raspberry Pi. It provides several ready-to-use classes which allows the developers to control the Pi's hardware and develop your softwares.

---
### Features

[Patch list](raw.github.com/abidon/pvper/master/docs/patch-list.txt)

This release introduced partial support for the C++ language (static objects only), UART/serial output and usage of GPIO pins.

---
### Requirements

__pvper__ is pretty straight forward to build. All you need is an `arm-none-eabi gcc` (cross-)compiler.  
You can refer to [this guide](http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) in order to build a cross compiler.

---
### Building

I provided my own build system: `bs`; which is a simple bash script.

`bs` is based on a "task" system, like makefiles do. You can execute multiple task in an unique command. The following tasks are recognized:

* `clean`: remove the files produced by the compilation
* `compile`: build the kernel and it's dependencies
* `install`: copy the kernel and required files on a bootable media (edit the path to the media by editing the `DESTINATION` variable of the `bs` script).

Typical usage of the bs command: `bs compile install clean`

> This build system isn't viable for the future and will be replaced.
> I'm bad at makefiles, but I don't want to loose time learning CMake or Scons (or any alternative) at the moment.
> Contributions are welcome! If you want to provide an alternative to `bs`, take a look at the contributing section below.

### Contribute

__pvper__ is a freshly new project. My primary goal is to learn OS development and the ARM architecture. I will do mistakes, so I'm open to suggestions or bug fixes. I will accept better implementations, new features (if I need them), but I will deny pull requests with a lot of code and/or breaking changes at the moment.
